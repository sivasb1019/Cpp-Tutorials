/*
When the const pointer variable point to the value :
Syntax: data_type* const var_name;

Explanation:
-The values that are stored in the corresponding pointer variable iand j are modifiable, but the locations that are
pointed out by const - pointer variables where the corresponding values of x and y are stored aren�t modifiable.

Otherwise, the following error will appear :
-The pointer variables are constand pointing to the locations where the xand y are stored if we try to change the
address location then we�ll face the error.
