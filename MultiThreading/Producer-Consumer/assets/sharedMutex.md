# Shared Mutex

A **shared mutex** (`std::shared_mutex` in C++) is used when you need to manage access to a shared resource in a way that allows multiple threads to read the resource concurrently but ensures exclusive access for a single thread when writing to the resource. 

### When to Use a Shared Mutex:

1. **When you have a read-heavy workload (many readers, few writers)**:
   - If most of the operations on the resource involve reading (which doesn't modify the data) and only a few operations involve writing (modifying the data), a shared mutex allows you to optimize access.
   - **Why?**: Multiple threads can read the data at the same time without blocking each other, but when a thread needs to write, it blocks all other threads (both readers and writers) to ensure that the data is updated safely.

2. **When you need to protect a shared resource from data races**:
   - A shared mutex allows you to ensure mutual exclusion, which is important to avoid data races when multiple threads are accessing the same resource.
   - **Why?**: The shared mutex allows multiple readers but only a single writer, preventing concurrent modifications or conflicting reads and writes to the shared resource.

3. **When you want to differentiate read and write access**:
   - A shared mutex allows **shared (read) locks** and **exclusive (write) locks**, enabling you to distinguish between operations that just read the data and those that modify it. This is useful when reading is more frequent than writing, and you want to allow high concurrency for reads while ensuring exclusive access for writes.
   - **Why?**: It allows you to maximize concurrency for reading operations and minimize contention, only blocking readers when a write operation is occurring.

### Key Use Case Scenarios:

1. **Cache systems**:
   - **Example**: Imagine a cache system where most of the threads are reading cached data and only a few threads are updating the cache. A shared mutex can ensure that while threads read from the cache concurrently, the write operation (which modifies the cache) happens exclusively.

2. **Database-like systems**:
   - **Example**: In a simple database system, you might have many threads querying the database (read operations) but fewer threads that need to update the data (write operations). Using a shared mutex ensures that multiple threads can query concurrently without blocking each other but prevents race conditions when updates are made.

3. **Shared configuration data**:
   - **Example**: If multiple threads need access to a shared configuration object (read-only), but only one thread can modify the configuration at a time, a shared mutex is appropriate. It allows the configuration data to be read by many threads simultaneously, but only one thread can update the configuration at any given time.

4. **Monitoring and statistics**:
   - **Example**: If a system is collecting statistics, many threads might be reading statistics, but only one thread should update those statistics at a time (e.g., counters). The shared mutex would allow efficient concurrent reading and exclusive updating.

### Advantages of Shared Mutex:

- **Concurrency for Readers**: Shared mutexes allow multiple threads to hold read locks at the same time, which increases concurrency and improves performance in scenarios where reads are far more frequent than writes.
- **Exclusive Access for Writers**: Writers can acquire an exclusive lock, blocking all other operations (both readers and writers) to safely update the shared resource.

### Disadvantages of Shared Mutex:

- **Writer Starvation**: If there are many readers constantly holding the shared lock, writers might be starved and unable to acquire the exclusive lock. This can be addressed using techniques like fair locking or timeouts, but it's a potential drawback in certain scenarios.
- **Complexity**: Managing locks and ensuring no deadlocks in a multi-threaded system can become more complex when dealing with shared/exclusive locks, especially when you're not careful with lock acquisition and release order.

### When **Not** to Use a Shared Mutex:

1. **When there is a high write-to-read ratio**:
